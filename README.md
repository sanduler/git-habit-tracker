# Git Commit Tracker

A simple habit tracker using Pixela API. The program generates a username, graph, and pixels using
that the user has on his own page. The ability to get, post, update and delete the pixel was implemented.
The next step is to create a fully functional GUI and provide the user the ability to input the date visually.



## Features

- Create a new user account
- implemented the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

## Future Features
- Fully functional GUI
- Ability to change color of the graph1
- Ability tp POST, PUT, DELETE directly from the GUI
- User input from past date
- GitHub API integration.
